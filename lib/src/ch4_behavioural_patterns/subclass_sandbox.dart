/// Subclass sandbox involves making use of base classes (abstract or otherwise)
/// to describe a common set of expected behaviours among many different kinds
/// of entities.
///
/// E.g. a base Superpower class and various extending classes that define
/// behaviour associated with Flight, Invisibility, etc.
///
/// Implementation of this pattern should be application-specific.
